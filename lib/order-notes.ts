/**
 * The order-notes carrier: everything the webhook will need, packed to fit
 * inside a Razorpay order.
 *
 * The constraint is hard and unforgiving: Razorpay accepts a MAXIMUM OF 15
 * note key-value pairs, each value at most 256 characters, and exceeding
 * either REJECTS THE ORDER outright. It does not drop the extra note and carry
 * on. So a naive "one key per field" layout runs out of room at exactly the
 * moment the payload grows, and it fails at the till, for the buyer, on a live
 * page.
 *
 * So the layout is five READABLE keys, for whoever opens the payment in the
 * Razorpay dashboard at 11pm trying to work out who a refund belongs to:
 *
 *     kind, lead_id, name, email, phone
 *
 * and ten CHUNK keys, `x0` through `x9`, holding one JSON object sliced into
 * 256-character pieces. 2,560 characters of carrier against a worst case near
 * 1,600 once every field is at its cap, so there is real headroom rather than
 * one spare slot.
 *
 * The chunks are opaque in the dashboard, which is the price paid, and it is
 * why the five human fields stay outside them.
