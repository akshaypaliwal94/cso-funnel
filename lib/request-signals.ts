/**
 * The two signals only the SERVER can read honestly: the caller's IP and their
 * user agent.
 *
 * Meta counts `client_ip_address` and `client_user_agent` as match keys, and
 * they are the two that cost the most when missing: an event without them
 * loses the browser-fingerprint half of the match and the EMQ score drops
 * accordingly. A browser cannot supply its own IP, and a user agent sent up in
 * a JSON body is trivially forgeable, so both are taken from request headers.
 *
 * WHERE they are read is the whole trick. The Razorpay webhook is a request
 * from Razorpay, not from the buyer, so its headers carry Razorpay's IP and
 * Razorpay's agent. Reading them there would ship a confidently wrong value,
 * which is worse for matching than shipping nothing. So they are captured at
 * create-order time (the last request the buyer's own browser makes before the
 * payment sheet takes over) and carried to the webhook in the order notes.
 *
 * Header order matters. `x-forwarded-for` is a comma-separated chain in which
 * the ORIGINAL client is first and every proxy appends itself, so taking the
 * last entry yields the CDN's own address. Vercel's `x-vercel-forwarded-for`
 * and Cloudflare's `cf-connecting-ip` are single-value and already resolved,
 * so they are preferred where present.
