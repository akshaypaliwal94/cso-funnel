/**
 * Creates the Razorpay order the browser then pays.
 *
 * Called with the Razorpay REST API over fetch rather than the `razorpay` npm
 * package: order creation is one authenticated POST, and avoiding the package
 * keeps a dependency and its transitive tree out of a project whose entire
 * dependency list is next, react and react-dom. Nothing here needs installing.
 *
 * THE NOTES ARE THE POINT. Everything Meta needs to match the eventual
 * Purchase to a person and a campaign is written into the order here, because
 * the webhook that fires Purchase receives only what Razorpay stores. Signals
 * not written now are gone by then: the buyer may complete inside a bank app
 * and never return to a page that could report them.
 *
 * This is ALSO the last request the buyer's own browser makes before the
 * payment sheet takes over, which makes it the only honest place to read their
 * IP and user agent. The webhook is a request from Razorpay, so reading those
 * headers there would record Razorpay's server as the buyer's device.
 *
 * Razorpay allows 15 note keys at 256 chars each and REJECTS the order if
 * either limit is passed, so the machine-readable half of the record is packed
 * into chunked keys by lib/order-notes.ts rather than spread one field per key.
